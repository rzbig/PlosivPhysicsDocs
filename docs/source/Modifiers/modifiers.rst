Modifiers
============
A modifier is a customisable behaviour component that can be applied to a :role:`part` within the editor. There are x in total, divided into three categories: :role:`Physics <Category: Physics Modifiers>`, :role:`Controls <Category: Control Modifiers>` :role:`Widgets <Category: Widget Modifiers>`. Up to a total of 20 modifiers can be applied to a given part. Modifiers can be used to affect a multitude of properties of a part, including velocity, rotation, constraints, events, etc. They can be added to parts via either the modifier menu on the left side of the editor menu, or the inspector menu when a part is selected. Not all modifiers are compatible with one another, or on parts with particular physics constraints - any conflicts will be displayed as a :role:`warning` both in the editor view and on the modifier's inspector menu.
